About this project : 
The data for this project comes from a 2017 experiment by Walt Hickey, where 269,000 votes from 8,371 IP addresses were collected to rank 85 types of Halloween candies by popularity. Key candy attributes, such as the presence of chocolate, were examined to understand what drives consumer preferences. <br><br> The project aims to identify the top three treats to distribute on Halloween, ensuring that trick-or-treaters of all tastes find something they'll love. This analysis focuses on metrics like Win Percentage, Sugar Content, and Price, offering actionable insights for candy manufacturers and retailers. By understanding these factors, businesses can optimize product development, pricing, and marketing strategies to succeed during the Halloween season
